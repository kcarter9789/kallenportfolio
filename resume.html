Graduated with a Degree in Business Marketing in 2013 and began a career with Federal Express in 2015, after 5 years I transitioned to management because of my love for people and my ability to step comfortably into leadership positions. I believe anything you put your mind to is possible to achieve and have now begun my journey into web development.</a>
